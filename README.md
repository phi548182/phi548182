Hi, My name is Greyson. I'm a web and Nodejs developer. 
I am currently working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I can also use Nodejs.
I'm looking to learn a bit of python sooner or later.
If you want to contact me, you can message me on Discord: grey the gravy#7989 or you can message me through Email: bleppysnek@gmail.com.
One of my current projects is a Discord bot which you can find in my projects. It is open source, feel free to modify it (or just steal the code, I don't really mind), or change it so it can fit your needs.
